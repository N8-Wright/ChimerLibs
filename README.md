# Chimer Libs

These are helpful libraries that I've extracted into their own project
so that I can work on them separately and use in many of my other hobby
projects.

## Contents

### [Chimer.Core](include/Chimer.Core/)

Core components used by other libraries.

### [Chimer.Logging](include/Chimer.Logging/)

A simple logging library.

### [Chimer.TestFramework](include/Chimer.TestFramework/)

being used are in the  [Chimer.TestFramework.Tests](src/Chimer.TestFramework.Tests/) project.
